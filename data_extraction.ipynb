The experience&nbsp;that a company provides is as important as its products and services. Innovative enterprises&nbsp;today recognize the revenue creation potential of contact centers through improved customer&nbsp;experience, as opposed to the traditional view of them as cost centers. However, a large number of contact centers continue to run on outdated legacy systems and old technologies,&nbsp;leading to poor customer experience, agent dissatisfaction, and increasing operational costs.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Skit developed a Voice-AI powered call center automation platform designed to have human like conversations through over 10 million hours of training data. Our platform can respond in&nbsp;over 16+ languages, covering 160+ dialects, and replicating human-like conversations.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Since 2020, we&rsquo;ve quadrupled our number of customers and revenue and our average order&nbsp;book has been growing at a CAGR 200-300% annually. This explosive growth has helped us&nbsp;secure $23M in Series B financing to rapidly scale to new markets.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Skit serves a variety of enterprise clients across diverse sectors such as Banking, Insurance,&nbsp;Food and Beverage, Consumer Durables, E-commerce, and Travel and Tourism.
