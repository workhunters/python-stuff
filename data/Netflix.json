We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 220 million paid subscribers, and are expanding into new forms of entertainment such as gaming. Engineering teams within Netflix work hard every day to scale and innovate this content production and membership experience in an ever-growing complex software landscape.  \n\nPlatform Networking team’s mission is to deliver a scalable, reliable, secure, agile, and efficient Network-as-a-Service to provide innovative experiences for our members and content creators around the world.\n\nWe are hiring for multiple roles - here's a spotlight on each team:\n\nCloud Network Engineering\nThe Cloud Network Engineering team’s goal is to create network architectures that can readily evolve with the needs of our product services and initiatives. We achieve this goal by developing tools and services that improve network availability, scale, and security. Our domain ownership is divided into two high-level segments: Cloud Network Infrastructure and Host Networking. Our goals are to scale streaming service and support our expanded business use-cases of Studio, Gaming and Animation. We deliver on these goals via our mission to evolve, manage, optimize and scale the network on Netflix’s compute infrastructure. \n\nNetwork Services and Insights\nThe Network Services & Insights team is focused on the Network-as-a-Service experience - a high-level, transparent, elastic connectivity abstraction relied upon by other engineers. To achieve this we are completely rethinking how our connectivity is being interacted with by developers, unifying and expanding our Insights & DNS platforms, and building out new services on top of the central InfraAPI (K8S). We are uniquely positioned to collaborate with both the other infra teams and the end developers offering broad opportunities for company-wide impact.\n\nCloud Gateway\nCloud Gateway provides a consistent traffic management story throughout the Netflix ecosystem and owns Netflix’s flagship open-source API Gateway Zuul. This team is responsible for designing, developing, and operating Edge Gateways for steaming and studio applications that are the front door for all control plane traffic coming into the cloud and help ensure 200+ millions of members have a fast, reliable, and secure streaming experience. The team owns Pushy, a notification system responsible for pushing messages from the cloud to millions of our clients in the field. Self Service Routing (SSR) provides the ability to provision on-the-fly policies that support a variety of actions to apply the incoming requests at Zuul. As a member of this team, you will own a large portion of the feature set that Zuul provides, comprising everything from networking and protocol work to high-level product features directly impacting the customer experience. This role will have a broad impact and will give you the opportunity to partner with device teams, product teams, and cloud infrastructure teams.\n\nService Networking\nThe Service Networking team is focused on creating a consistent, seamless, secure, and adaptive infrastructure for internal service discovery and communication across Netflix. To this end we are migrating our current SDK-based communication architecture to a centralized sidecar service mesh, and are investigating the future of service discovery as the Netflix ecosystem continues to scale.
